# Neural Network Numpy Only
Build a neural network using numpy only.

- MNIST Dataset
 
  - I use the MNIST database which consists of images of handwritten numbers and their labels.

- Model Architecture
  - Input layer: 768
  - hidden layer: 64
  - output layer: 10

- Hyperparameters
  - You can modify hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate in train.py.

- Prerequisite
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Training
`python3 train.py`

## Special thanks
